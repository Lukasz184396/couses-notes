OAuth Access delegation

Example - import from google drive to print photo app service.
Both services photo service and google drvive service trust user,
but do not trus other services.

So when photo service ask about access to the google drive file
google drive tell user that service photo ask about permision to print the file.
So User has information inform which service wants access to what resource
and what permission he is requesting.
If user accept then google sends token to print service.
Token conteins only limited permission. it is a VALLET KEY
this is key with limited permisions.
EVERY TIME PHOTO SERVICE NEEDS ACCESS TO THIS FILE HE
SENDS IN REQUEST TOKEN.

TOKEN FORMAT IS JWT. JAVA WEB TOKEN
