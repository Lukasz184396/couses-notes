Take some breakes 10 mins.

Focused Mode - when you are trying to learn
something new, you must first focus intently on it in order
to “turn on” those parts of the brain and get the learning
process started.

Diffuse mode - when your mind is relaxed and free.
The diffuse mode helps you make
imaginative connections between ideas. Creativity often seems
to pop out of using the diffuse mode.

If we want to shift from thinking about the details to thinking freely
about the bigger picture, we have to shift from focused to
diffuse mode.

Boost Your Reading Power with Active Recall !!!!!!!
Active recall means bringing an idea back to
mind. Actively recalling key ideas you are learning
has been shown to be a great way to understand
them

This is the critical part. Look away from the
page and see what you can recall. What are the
key ideas on the page? Play them back in your
mind. Or say them out loud to yourself. Do not
simply reread the page over and over again. And
don’t underline or highlight big amounts of text.
